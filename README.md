# CampsiteSearcher
This app is used to help people prepare for their camping trip by making it convenient for them to look up campgrounds or other important locations, like camping stoves.

Something to note is that a private file labelled "keys.xml" has not been included since API keys should remain private. If you wish to use this app, then you need to provide your own.
